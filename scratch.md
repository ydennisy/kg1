# Scratch

This is a page to throw ideas, refs, etc and delete as soon as possible.

## ideas

- check out ra-dit paper, and its references
- we can have kg1 run locally, so all data is local, but a ActivityPub stream has things published and displayed centrally
- this would be a nice local + social
- would also allow to use DBs locally cheaper.

todo:

- add an admin flow, for different chunking (rechunking) strategies
- use a google like UI for search
- create a extension which allows to index from a right click in the browser - bitwarden extension has this.
