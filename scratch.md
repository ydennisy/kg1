# Scratch

This is a page to throw ideas, refs, etc and delete as soon as possible.

## ideas

- check out ra-dit paper, and its references
- we can have kg1 run locally, so all data is local, but a ActivityPub stream has things published and displayed centrally
- this would be a nice local + social
- would also allow to use DBs locally cheaper.
