# `KG1`

KG1 is a personal knowledge management application.

The long term vision is to satisfy the following main functions:

- Do not worry about structure of your knowledge graph, just throw stuff in there.
- Social apps do not all have to be 2 second videos of cats, deep thoughts can also be fun to share.
- Infuse the app with AI to help you store, find, reason and explore both your own and the world's knowledge!

Ok, but what can we do today?

Not much yet:

- You are able to add a `node`, which can be text, link or a combination.
- You are able to search these using dense embeddings.
- You can chat with an AI using the `nodes` stored in KG1 (RAG).
