# `KG1`

KG1 is a knowledge management application, infused with AI.
You can access a hosted version at [kg1.io](https://kg1.io).

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is currently in a very early development/experimental stage.
> Please do not rely on the hosted version, data cannot be considered "long-term persisted".

**The long term vision is of this project is to:**

- Develop an abstract and general encoding of knowledge.
- Connect knowledge nodes into a personal graph in an automated manner.
- Allow people to connect their local sub graphs via a decentralised protocol.
- Augment the knowledge in the graph through agentic assistance.

**Ok, but what can it do today?**

Not much really, currently this is a fairly based retrieval augment generation (RAG) application, where you can:

- Index new documents (URLs).
- Search across all the indexed documents (URLs).
- Ask question of the documents (RAG) using an LLM.

Please take a look at the demo video below for the current state of the project or have a look
for yourself at [kg1.io](https://kg1.io).
