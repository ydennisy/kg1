https://t.co/DWZ1nTPCwb,[2311.09677] R-Tuning: Teaching Large Language Models to Refuse Unknown Questions,"Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous domains with their impressive performance but still face their challenges. A predominant issue is the propensity for these models to generate non-existent facts, a concern termed hallucination. Our research is motivated by the observation that previous instruction tuning methods force the model to complete a sentence no matter whether the model knows the knowledge or not. When the question is out of the parametric knowledge, it will try to make up something and fail to indicate when it lacks knowledge. In this paper, we present a new approach called Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning). This approach is formalized by first identifying the knowledge gap between parametric knowledge and the instruction tuning data. Then, we construct the refusal-aware data based on the knowledge intersection, to tune LLMs to refrain from responding to questions beyond its parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate this new instruction tuning approach effectively improves a model's ability to answer known questions and refrain from answering unknown questions. Furthermore, when tested on out-of-domain datasets, the refusal ability was found to be a meta-skill that could be generalized to other tasks. Further analysis surprisingly finds that learning the uncertainty during training displays a better ability to estimate uncertainty than uncertainty-based testing. Our code will be released at https://github.com/shizhediao/R-Tuning.",False,False

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to the retrieval of relevant information from external knowledge bases before answering questions with LLMs. RAG has been demonstrated to significantly enhance answer accuracy, reduce model hallucination, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks. By citing sources, users can verify the accuracy of answers and increase trust in model outputs. It also facilitates knowledge updates and the introduction of domain-specific knowledge. RAG effectively combines the parameterized knowledge of LLMs with non-parameterized external knowledge bases, making it one of the most important methods for implementing large language models. This paper outlines the development paradigms of RAG in the era of LLMs, summarizing three paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. It then provides a summary and organization of the three main components of RAG: retriever, generator, and augmentation methods, along with key technologies in each component. Furthermore, it discusses how to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG models, introducing two evaluation methods for RAG, emphasizing key metrics and abilities for evaluation, and presenting the latest automatic evaluation framework. Finally, potential future research directions are introduced from three aspects: vertical optimization, horizontal scalability, and the technical stack and ecosystem of RAG.",False,False

In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.",False,False

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads.
