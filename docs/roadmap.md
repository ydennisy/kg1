# Roadmap / Ideas

- check out ra-dit paper, and its references
- we can have kg1 run locally, so all data is local, but a ActivityPub stream has things published and displayed centrally
- this would be a nice local + social
- would also allow to use DBs locally cheaper.
- add an admin flow, for different chunking (rechunking) strategies
